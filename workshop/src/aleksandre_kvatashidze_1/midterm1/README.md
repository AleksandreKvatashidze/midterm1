## Challenges Faced and Resolutions

During the exam, I encountered several challenges related to understanding the core concepts and ensuring the system was correctly implemented:

1. **Understanding New Java Constructs**: One challenge was understanding certain Java constructs that I hadn't encountered before, such as **Java Collections** (like `ArrayList` and `HashMap`) and how to effectively use them for managing teams, participants, and event details. To overcome this, I reviewed online tutorials, documentation, and referenced example code snippets to get a clearer picture of how to manage lists and maps in Java.

2. **System Structure and Design**: Another challenge was properly organizing the system into modules and classes. Initially, I struggled with how to effectively structure the classes for managing events, teams, and players. To resolve this, I researched design patterns and best practices for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which helped me decide on the class breakdown and object interactions.

3. **Handling Exceptions and Edge Cases**: I also encountered challenges related to error handling. For instance, I had to ensure that users couldn’t register more than one team under the same name or that the system didn’t accept invalid date formats. I resolved these issues by incorporating simple exception handling with `try-catch` blocks and validating inputs before processing them.

## Use of AI Tools

AI tools proved to be extremely useful in helping me understand some of the Java constructs that were new to me during this exam. Here are the specific tasks where AI was helpful:

1. **Understanding Java Collections**: I needed clarification on how to use `ArrayList` and `HashMap` to store event data, participants, and results. AI tools helped me quickly understand the syntax, use cases, and examples of how to implement these collections in the project.

2. **Writing Specific Code Blocks**: When I was trying to implement the **Player Statistics** feature, AI helped me generate a class structure with the necessary methods for tracking player stats like goals, assists, and penalties. This significantly sped up the process of building this feature and allowed me to focus on the core logic of the project.

3. **Code Refactoring and Best Practices**: AI tools also assisted in refining my code. For instance, when I needed suggestions on improving the readability and efficiency of my methods, AI provided helpful insights into proper naming conventions and how to better structure certain logic.

In these tasks, AI was directly used to:
- **Generate code snippets** (e.g., `ArrayList` and `HashMap` usage).
- **Explain Java concepts** (like classes and methods).
- **Refactor code for better efficiency and readability**.

## Cases Where AI Wasn't as Helpful

Despite AI being useful in many tasks, there were situations where it didn't provide the desired results:

1. **Complex Debugging**: When I faced issues related to the program crashing due to invalid input, AI struggled to pinpoint the exact line where the problem occurred. Although AI could suggest adding more error handling, it wasn’t able to debug the program with specific details, leaving me to resolve the issue through trial and error and using traditional debugging methods (like print statements and the Java debugger).

2. **Understanding Business Logic**: AI was not very helpful when it came to understanding the **business logic** of the system. For example, determining how the match scheduling system should handle specific edge cases (like handling draw results or overtime rules) was beyond the AI’s scope. I had to rely on my own understanding of the requirements and the system's purpose.

3. **Performance Optimization**: AI didn’t provide any meaningful insights on optimizing the performance of my code (e.g., reducing time complexity or handling large datasets). While AI could help with small snippets and algorithmic explanations, it was not able to suggest a more optimal structure for managing large-scale events.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, AI tools were incredibly valuable for speeding up the development of certain parts of the **Sports Event Management System** by helping with code generation, explanations, and understanding new Java constructs. However, when it came to debugging, complex logic design, and performance optimizations, AI was less effective. In these cases, I had to rely more on my own coding skills and problem-solving techniques.
